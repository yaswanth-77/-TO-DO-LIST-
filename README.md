# -TO-DO-LIST-
A to-do list is a list of tasks that need to be completed, typically organized in  order of priority. It is one of the simplest solutions for task management and  provides a minimal and elegant way for managing tasks a person wishes to  accomplish. Our aim is to design a simple and elegant website for people to keep  a track of the tasks.
